Starting from the transmission station with infinite speed, slowing down to the speed
of light at a distance of 6,000 miles, then increasing in speed from that region, and
reaching the receiving station again with infinite velocity.
It's all a wonderful thing.
Wireless is coming to mankind in its full meaning like a hurricane some of these days.
Some day there will be, say, six great wireless telephone stations in a world system, connecting
all the inhabitants on this earth to one another, not only by voice, but by sight.
It's surely coming.
